* Repost
  
  Repost resubmits or otherwise dispatches emails delivered to
  SES. This can be used for redelivery to postfix for further handling
  or to pipe into another mail handler for application specific
  handling. Either way, your mail server is not directly exposed to
  the internet (whether by choice or not permitted to) and let's
  Amazon deal with the inital pass at spam filtering and DoS
  blocking. Nice!

  *Note: this is still being worked on and is missing critical
  functionality at this time*

* Building

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :no-expand :eval no
    # To build only the main binaries:
    nix-build -A repost release.nix

    # Or build the entire release including the docker container and the
    # binaries:
    nix-build release.nix
  #+END_SRC

* Testing

  Testing is also performed by the build above. If you can't build,
  either the code is bad or the tests aren't passing. Watch the output
  of the build.
